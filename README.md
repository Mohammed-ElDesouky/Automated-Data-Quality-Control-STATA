# Automated-Data-Quality-Control-STATA
This is a real use case of automating the process of quality control any micro economic data to ensure that the data possessing pipeline has not altered the raw data in any unfavorable manner. This shall ensure data integrity and reliability. The scripts is capable to examain and test for mulitiple individual datasets concurruntly, and will run the checks and outputs a standard formatted QA report in an .xlsx format.

c- Changes to # of observations with a missing unique ID between raw and processed data
d- Changes to # of features/varibales between raw and processed data

### Pre-requisists for error-free implmentation 
To ensure that the script will run with no error, please ensure the following:
- Redefine file paths and data directories (at the top of the script) according to your machine and workflow.
